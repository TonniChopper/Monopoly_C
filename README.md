# Abstract Monopoly Game

## Overview

Welcome to the Abstract Monopoly Game, a customizable and engaging simulation of the classic Monopoly board game. In this version, players have the flexibility to manually control the dice rolls, manage property purchases, and customize the game board. The game incorporates several features to enhance the traditional Monopoly experience and offers various reporting options to track game progress.

## Features

- **Custom Dice Rolls**: Unlike the classic Monopoly, players can choose their own dice rolls instead of relying on random outcomes. This feature adds a strategic element to the game.
  
- **Mandatory Property Purchases**: Players are required to buy any property they land on, adding an extra layer of strategic decision-making.

- **Bankruptcy and Financial Management**: The game ends if a player goes bankrupt or cannot afford to pay rent or purchase property, creating a realistic and challenging gameplay experience.

- **Customizable Game Board**: The game board can be edited and customized using a simple text file. This allows players to add, modify, or remove properties and other board elements according to their preferences.

- **Result Reporting**: The game provides different types of result reporting:
  - **Brief Report**: A concise summary of each turn.
  - **General Report**: A comprehensive overview of the game's progress.
  - **Full Report**: A detailed account of all game activities and events.

- **Future Enhancements**: Although the game board is not yet visually rendered, plans are in place to integrate a library for graphical display, such as `ncurses`, to provide a more immersive experience.
